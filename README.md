This is ZType! Ztype is a simple typing practice game where the only objective is to, well, type! Once you start the game by running the program, just start typing by of the randomly generated 6 character text blocks. Once you have started a word, you will be "locked" into finishing that word, signaled by the text turning red, as shown in the gif. The game is well endless so try to type for as long as you can!
