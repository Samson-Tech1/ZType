The objective of this game is to quickly type out the random string of length 6 before those strings reach the ground.
Once the game has begun, if you type the first letter of any of the strings present, that string will turn red.
After this happens, the user will be locked into finishing that specific string. 
It is recommended that the user starts with the word closest to the bottom and continues from there.
Once a string is finished, move on the next string and go from there until you lose and the game ends.
The game ends when a word, either black or red, touches the bottom of the screen.
A "You Lost" message will display to convey the end of the game session.
